# Project Description
The purpose of this project is to detect when an infant has stopped breathing by activating a trigger, using the STM32F429i microcontroller. We used the STM32F429i microcontroller along with the MAX30102 sensor. For this project, we decided to build an app that will help display the values that are read from the sensor. The app also provides a warning that let's the patient/caregiver know when the breathing has stopped.

# Code Description
The coding is split into two parts. The first part is based on the connection of the microcontroller and the MAX30102. The second part is what was used to construst the application.
For the first part, we constructed the connection between the microcontroller and the MAX30102 sensor to read values of the heart rate and breathing rate of a patient.

For the second part, we developed an application for iPhone to display the data in a more understanding way that would make it easy for the average person to understand.
